1. Create a dictionary called transcript that has keys for the semesters that you have been at AU. Set the corresponding values to a list of
lists of the courses taken during that semester. Each course is a list:
[Four digit subject, Course Number, Section, Title].
For Fall14 [CSCI,156,01,'Computer Science I'] would be one of the courses in your list. Don't worry about the accuracy of
the section data, no one is going to compare your transcript with your program. Make up at least two years worth of data.

2. Write a procedure that prints your transcript in a nice way.

3. Write a procedure semesters(subject) which returns a list of the semesters in which you took a course in the subject 
area subject. So if called subject('MATH') then you would get back a list of the semesters in which you took a math class.
